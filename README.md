## Current State
It is just a timer and it is only toggling between work sessions and short breaks. Thats it. For what it planned, see todos below.

## How to get
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Plsr/reportty/releases) on github. Only zip, no `.dmg` at this time. Sorry.

## Todos
- [ ] Add long break every 4 work sessions
- [ ] Keep logs of sessions on a day
- [ ] Allow adding tasks and associating them to timers
- [ ] Display how many timers and how much actual time a task took

Built with [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate).
